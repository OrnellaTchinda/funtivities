My learning was focused on creating a full-stack web application where users could add the activities they will like to do either by themselves or with their families. 

## Optimizations

As I'm improving this project, I would like to work more on the front end of the application to make it more user-friendly; I would also like to create a calendar tab where each user could add the day they plan to make the activity.
