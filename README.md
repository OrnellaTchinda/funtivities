My learning was focused on creating a full-stack web application where users could add the activities they will like to do either by themselves or with their families. 

## Optimizations

As I work on improving this project, my focus will be on enhancing the application's front end to improve user-friendliness. Additionally, I plan to incorporate a calendar tab, allowing users to schedule the days they intend to engage in specific activities. Moreover, I aim to enable users to browse activities based on various skills.
